# Some info 
My name is Jon ***2E0OPT*** I took my Amateur radio foundation license exam in Feb 2020 and getting the callsign *M7KMW* whilst under lockdown studied and later passed the Intermediate license exam and took my current callsign of *2E0OPT*. In the meantime due to lack of a local amateur radio club I found and joined [The Online Radio club](https://onlineradioclub.org/) I've learnt so much about the hobby from the members and I'll forever be grateful for the help I received along the way, all the silly questions I had answered by the more knowledgeable members. It was during this time I developed a interest in digital voice and the underlying systems it has. I started openreflector.com as a way to document my adventures in amateur radio, In particular Digital voice and my [Digital voice reflector](http://xlx.openreflector.com) It's a nice place in the hobby where some of my other skills crossover with amateur radio. Don't get me wrong this site won't just be about Digital voice I do work HF, Digtal modes (such as PSK31, Olivia and HELL) and analog VHF/UHF (4m and 6m bands included, soon hopefully!) and I plan to look into amateur satellites too.


My vision for this website is not to spoon-feed knowledge in the way of walkthroughs but hopefully be a place where those following the same path may pick up snippets of information that will help further them in their journey.
