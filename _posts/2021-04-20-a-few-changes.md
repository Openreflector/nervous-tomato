I thought I'd post about my recent changes to openreflector. Mainly that I've decided to shut XLX 497, I've learnt a pile about digital voice while learning to set this up and it's been fun. However looking over the list of active XLX instances I've come to the conclusion that less is better. XLX 497 wasn't *needed* as quite frankly a lot don't. There seem's to be a lot of people setting up instance(s) of digital voice reflectors, server etc for no other reason to have their own thing. Too many servers and not enough people to use the ones we have without adding more and more to the list. I think that concentrating users onto fewer servers/reflectors is the right idea.


I will be keeping the allstar nodes active and I may even try and get some regular nets going. So watch this space.   

Anyway thats enough for now
