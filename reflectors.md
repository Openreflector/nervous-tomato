### Current reflectors hosted and run by openreflector.com

- [XLX497](http://xlx.openreflector.com/)
- YSF reflector 69742
- P25 Talkgroup 994 
- Allstar node: 525500, 525501

## Whats next?
I currently have a few things I want to experiment with and try. ~~Allstar being one of them.~~ I'd love to setup my own DMR server as well.  

### What I have no intention of setting up.
__ECHOLINK__, ugh I recently signed up for a -L account to setup a echolink bridge into my pre existing xlx setup. My application got denied on the account that I am *only* a intermediate license holder. What gave me a sour taste is that when you look through the list of -L stations there are plenty of Foundation and intermediate license holders. Gatekeeping for gatekeeping's sake in my opinion. I want no part of it.
